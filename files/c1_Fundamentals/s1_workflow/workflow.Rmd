The NISS data science course spans the entire data science workflow or process. The most common version of this process is illustrated by:   

![The Data Science Process](figures/dsciProcess.png)  

This diagram is taken from [Doing Data Science](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do) referenced at the end of this module.

The course initially will focus on the items along the top, i.e., raw data is collected, data is processed, and data is cleaned. Exploratory data analyses will also be covered. We then cover the box on the right---machine learning algorithms and statistical models. We also cover data visualization in the lower right box. Finally, we cover the Data Products box as an in-depth example.

Hadley Wickham has a more abbreviated and specific version given here: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#what-you-will-learn).

It focuses on `tidyr` to make data tidy, `dplyr` for transforming the data, `ggplot2` for visualization, various modeling functons such as `lm`, and R markdown or Shiny for communication. We will often be using his approach in this course.
